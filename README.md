# 📈 Closing Price Prediction Project
This project utilizes XGBoost to predict the closing prices of a specific company (Intercorp) using data from the country's context (Peru).

Leave a ⭐ to motivate me to improve this project!

## 📋 Description
The main.py script performs the following tasks:

<img align="right" src="https://i.giphy.com/gutZ5Pm6Xl62eIf5RZ.webp" height="230">

- 📦 Imports necessary packages.
- 📄 Loads data from a CSV file.
- 📊 Visualizes the closing price data.
- ✂️ Splits the data into training and testing sets.
- 🎯 Defines the features and target variable.
- 🤖 Creates and trains a regression models.
- 🔮 Makes predictions with the test set.
- 📈 Displays the predictions and real values.
- 🧮 Calculates and displays the model accuracy.
- 🖼️ Plots the actual closing prices and predictions.

## 🛠️ Requirements
Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed before running the script:

- pandas
- xgboost
- matplotlib
- randomforest
  
## 📥 Installation
You can install them using pip:

```
pip install pandas xgboost matplotlib RandomForestClassifier
```

Import dependencies
```
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

You also have to import the dependencies from sklearn:

```
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import precision_score
```

## ✨ Features

- Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values and formats the data appropriately.
- Feature Engineering: Extracts and creates new features to improve model performance.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizes model parameters using techniques like grid search.
- Cross-Validation: Implements cross-validation to ensure model robustness.
- Model Saving: Saves the trained model for future use without retraining.
- Logging: Provides detailed logs of the training process for better debugging and analysis.
- Interactive Visualizations: Creates interactive plots for a more dynamic data exploration.
