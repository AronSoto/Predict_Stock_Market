# Closing Price Prediction Project
This project utilizes XGBoost to predict the closing prices of a specific company (Intercorp) using data from the country's context (Peru).

## Description
The main.py script performs the following tasks:

- Imports necessary packages.
- Loads data from a CSV file.
- Visualizes the closing price data.
- Splits the data into training and testing sets.
- Defines the features and target variable.
- Creates and trains a regression model using XGBoost.
- Makes predictions with the test set.
- Displays the predictions and real values.
- Calculates and displays the model accuracy.
- Plots the actual closing prices and predictions.

## Requirements
Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed before running the script:

- pandas
- xgboost
- matplotlib

## You can install them using pip:
```
pip install pandas xgboost matplotlib
```
